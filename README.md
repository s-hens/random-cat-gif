### Random Cat .gif Generator

### [Live demo](https://s-hens.github.io/random-cat-gif/)

## Summary

Generates random cat gifs using the free Giphy API. Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.

The API key is exposed in the code because it's free and the project has no backend.

## I learned about...
