# Random Cat .gif Generator

### [Live demo](https://s-hens.github.io/random-cat-gif/)

## Summary

Generates random cat gifs using the free Giphy API. Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.

The API key is exposed in the code because:
- It's a free API
- It's a small, just-for-fun project
- The project has no backend

## I learned about...

- Asynchronous code
- Working with APIs
- API key protection
